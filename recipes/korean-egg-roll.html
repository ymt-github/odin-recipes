    <p>Delicious Korean egg roll (Gyeran Mari) recipe!</p>
    <img src="images/korean-egg-roll.jpg" alt="Korean Egg Roll">
    <p>Korean egg roll is a popular Korean side dish. The ingredients are quite readily accessible, so my mom used to make it a lot for us.</p>
    <p>Also, because the egg looks pretty and and quite compact, it‚Äôs popular in a school lunch box. I always loved having it in my box! Lastly, it‚Äôs also a popular drink snack with soju (Korean distilled liquor).</p>
    <p>Well seasoned, Korean egg roll is savory and slightly salty. It‚Äôs perfect with a bowl of steamed rice. You can also squeeze some tomato sauce / ketchup over the egg rolls to suit your taste.</p>

    <h2>What is korean egg roll?</h2>
    <p>I‚Äôm sure most of you already figured this part out, but I will spill it out any way. üôÇ</p>
    <p>Korean egg roll is called gyeran mari / gyeranmari (Í≥ÑÎûÄÎßêÏù¥). Gyeran (Í≥ÑÎûÄ) means egg and mari (ÎßêÏù¥) describes the status of being rolled up. So, essentially, Korean egg roll, Korean rolled egg and Korean rolled omelette means the same thing!</p>
    <p>Another thing to note is Korean egg roll is cooked much like Japanese egg roll ‚Äì <strong>tamagoyaki</strong>. (Frankly speaking, I can‚Äôt tell if there‚Äôs a big difference, but in my memory, tamagoyaki always seem sweeter than gyeran mari.)</p>

    <h2>Common Korean egg roll Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Obviously, the most important ingredients for Korean egg roll is egg, then salt. You can make it with these two ingredients only if you want.</p>
    <p>Other popular ingredients are finely diced bell peppers, carrots, zucchini, onion, ham, crab meat, canned tuna and roasted seaweed etc. The list can go on.</p>
    <p>And, in this recipe, I used green onion and shredded mozzarella cheese, which are also popular to add. They add a nice flavor and cheesy aroma to the egg, so I‚Äôm sure you will like them!</p>

    <h2>Use of rolled omelette pan / Japanese omelette pan</h2>
    <p>In the past, I‚Äôve been making this Korean egg roll in a round cast iron skillet, which works fine, by the way! But, I recently invested in a non-stick rectangular pan that is suitable for my induction cooktop, to make the cooking process easier and faster! (This is the one I got, but you can also get a cheaper one like this one.)</p>
    <p>There‚Äôs no need to buy this specialty omelette pan but it does make the cooking easier and faster. Also, I think you can make nicely shaped egg rolls in a more consistent way using this pan. Anyway, something to think about!</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy making Korean egg roll soon!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Break the eggs in a medium sized bowl and beat the eggs lightly. To give a smooth texture, sieve through the eggs. Add the rice wine and salt then whisk them well. (If you haven‚Äôt already, move the egg mixture into a measuring cup with a handle so that it‚Äôs easier to pour it out). Add the chopped green onion.</li>

        <li>Heat the pan on medium low heat and add some cooking oil. Spread it throughout the pan. Reduce the heat to low. Pour out a thin layer of egg mixture onto the pan and spread it by tilting the pan. Once the edge of the egg is cooked and the top of the egg is about 80 to 85% cooked, add a layer of cheese in the middle of the pan and start rolling the egg with a spatula and/or chopsticks.</li>

Repeat this step until the egg mixture is used up.</li>
